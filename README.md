# Monitoing
.NET monitoring is a critical aspect of .NET application development. It helps developers track the health and well-being of their applications to provide real-time performance reviews. Knowing the real status of your application ensures that users have round-the-clock access to your business site. 

.NET monitoring makes sure that your business is not impacted by application issues. For example, problems experienced during site navigation can discourage customers from making a purchase from your site. 

## Types of .NET Monitoring Tools
.NET monitoring helps developers in optimizing application performance. These tools provide quick assistance during critical events, such as low-level CPU and memory leaks.
<b>Standard</b>
Bad CPU and memory usage issues can be solved with standard .NET monitoring tools. Developers turn to standard .NET monitoring tools when CPU usage is out of control. It provides proactive CPU performance tuning and monitors high memory usage, optimizes memory usage, and finds memory leaks. 
These are valuable features, but are resource-intensive and will slow down your application.

## Lightweight
Developers use lightweight .NET monitoring tools every day. As the name suggests, it provides less performance impact on codes. Its lightweight architecture is handy despite its robust tracing mechanisms. These tracing features include code profiling to understand performance at a high level.

## APM
Recurring application issues in QA and development environments are common in software development. It is necessary to use monitoring tools that gather information on repeated problems. 
In dealing with more complex software development issues, monitoring tools might not be enough. Thatâ€™s where Application Performance Management (APM) comes in. Most APMs offer database queries, logging, exceptions, web service calls, and so on. More so, it helps developers understand the root cause of issues and how to fix bugs to improve application performance.

## .NET Monitoring Tools
.NET monitoring tool should look for the following features:
<ul>
  <li>Provides proactive performance monitoring</li>
  <li>Caters to full-stack Microsoft .NET Application performance monitoring</li>
  <li>Analyzes distributed server-side .NET Transactions</li>
  <li>Implements low-level .NET code insights and identify errors</li>
  <li>Provides in-depth monitoring of .NET framework, CLR, and IIS</li>
  <li>Troubleshoots faster with an automated root-cause diagnosis</li>
</ul>
